# Lonely agile wolf

This talk is about the Ruby as the language so powerful, that one guy
can do realy amazing things. But agile is mostly about groups and
companies so how does it work together? Let's find out.

It is all about Micro Entrepreneurship mixed with the power of the Ruby.
It will cover every corner of the project: from analysis to BDD, from
the coding to the communitation with the client.

## Josef Pospíšil

Born in year of the Dragon 1976. Father of two, friend of many.

First computer (Atari 800XL in 1986) (quite feat in Czechoslovak
Socialistic Republic). I got Masters in Informatics on Czech Univerzity
of Life Sciences.

I founded two companies, current just for me and my wife.

I am good in many languages from assembler for 8048 to well... Ruby.  I
was first rubyist in Czech Republic (2004), but due to my lurker
personality, I haven't got famous. I have some quite big projects under
my belt, mostly the internal development for the education. But now I am
finishing the labour of love project on which I would like to
demonstrate my talk main theme.

Please merge me cause I need to see Amsterdam after long long time!
