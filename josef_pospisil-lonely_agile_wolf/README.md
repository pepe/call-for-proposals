# Lonely agile wolf

This talk is about ruby as so powerful language, that one guy can do realy amazing things. But agile is mostly about groups and companies so how does it work together? Let's find out.


## Josef Pospíšil
Born in year of the Dragon 1976.

First computer (Atari 800XL in 1986) (quite feat in Czechoslovak socialistic republic). Maters in Informatics on Czech univerzity of life sciences. Second founded company.

I was first rubyist in Czech Republic, but due to my lurker personality, I haven't got famous. I have some quite big projects under my belt, mostly internal development for education. But now I am finishing one labour of love on which I would like to demonstrate my talk main theme.
